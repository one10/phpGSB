# Implementation of Google Safe Browsing

**phpGSB** is a robust implementation of the Google Safe Browsing API. It currently *does* allow the following:

* Updating of GSB lists to a MySQL database
* Basic checking of URLs' against lists and then full-hash checks against the full GSB database
* Caching of full-hash keys to minimise requests to the remote Google server

At current it *does not* allow the following:

* Requests using MAC keys (integrity checks)

The main class is definitely not as efficient as it could be and has developed very quickly to meet the basic GSB specification; any contributions, bug fixes etc are **very** welcome! 

## Download

* Installation using composer
```
$ composer require samcleaver/phpgsb
```

* You could manually download phpgsb by this link: https://github.com/samcleaver/phpGSB/archive/0.2.5.zip

## Installation

1. Enter database details into install.php (Replace DATABASE_USERNAME, DATABASE_NAME and DATABASE_PASSWORD with respective information)
2. Run install.php
3. Look at listupdater.php and lookup.php example files for basic methods on using the system.
4. If you choose to use listupdater.php as-is then set it as a cron job/scheduled task to run every minute. *(It won't actually update every minute but is required incase of backoff procedures and timeouts)*

5. Optional: set up a simple REST service based on lookup.fastcgi.php, FastCGI and a web server. E.g., configure an Nginx/FastCGI combo to point at the phpGSB directory, and see usage URL examples inside lookup.fastcgi.php. Works relatively well, tested on 100s of lookups/second. 

## FAQ

* **When I do a lookup, phpGSB says the URL is safe but I know it's not.**
*The database is updated in chunks from Google's central server. Because of this, you need to run updates for 24 hours before you can start doing lookups, this is a limitation of the specification and not the implementation. (Check Step 5 of installation on how to ensure updates are running.)*
